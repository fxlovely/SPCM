Shut down:

    1)  Login into head node
    2)  su -
    3)  cluster-admin

Boot sequence:

    1)  Head nodes
    2)  I/O nodes
    3)  Compute nodes

    I/O nodes will try to mount /home from primary head node on boot.

    Head nodes have mounts for I/O nodes in /etc/fstab, but they are set
    to noauto so the head nodes can boot first.  Run
    ~/CentOS-cluster-admin/head-mount-shares after I/O nodes are up.

    Compute nodes will try to mount I/O nodes, so they should be booted
    after I/O nodes are up.

Power outage:

    The head nodes and I/O nodes should remain up on generator power.

    Some compute nodes will try to boot as soon as power is restored.
    It is best to unplug their PDUs during a power outage until power
    is believed to be stable.  We began changing BIOS settings to
    prevent this, but have not gotten through all the nodes.

Avi disk replacement:

    Log into data.avi as root
    cd ~/Avi-admin/Incidents
    ./replace-disk
    Follow instructions on screen
