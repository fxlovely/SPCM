Enable ping on cluster for PacBio RS Remote software

Does order of creation of RAIDs in h710 matter for boot device?
    Boot dev must be disk group 0?

    NOTE:Interposer is not required to use this tray with a SATA hard drive
    for PowerEdge servers. Just mount the SATA drive the same way as SAS
    drives. However, interposers are required if you want to use SATA drives
    in PowerVault MD1000.

Separate /sharedapps partition so it can be mounted noexec on head nodes

Good enough:
    Host compute-*
	    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    Host login*
	    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    Host raid*
	    StrictHostKeyChecking no

Add java to default compute node yum installs

Install dos2unix on all nodes

Boot sequence:
    Primary head
    Data, backup head, backup data
    Compute
    head-mount-shares
    cluster-mount-nfs
    cluster-slurm-restart

/sharedapps/pkg-1/openmpi unreadable by default

/usr/pkg-1/lib/slurm unreadable by default

ipoib failure:

Test nfs/rdma

alt+d to show cnentos boot messages

cluster-setup io: chkconfig nfs on

File ownerships on /home showing as nobody:nobody
    Resolved by restarting rpcidmap

Make it impossible to overload the head node or any login node
    No file transfers
    CPU limits in limits.conf

Low soft-limit on memory use on new compute nodes
    Strict kernel allocation policies

Creating a USB stick install media
    1)  On CentOS 6.4 minimal, livecd-tools is not in the yum repository
	for some bizarre reason.
    2)  centos-iso-to-usb will install the necessary prereqs to use
	the livecd-iso-to-disk script kyped from another CentOS installation.



Benchmark all filesystems locally and from compute nodes before opening!
