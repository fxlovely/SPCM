	If RAID
	    Do not use logical volumes (cannot boot from them)
	    1.  Create identical RAID partitions for each partition on 
		both disks
		
		sda1 and sdb1 for /
		sda2 and sdb2 for swap
		
	    2.  Create RAID devices using matching partitions on each disk
		
		/       md0     sda1 & sdb1
		swap    md1     sda2 & sdb2
		...

vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

-----------------------------
svn co login@server:/path/CentOS-cluster-admin
cd CentOS-cluster-admin/Ad-hoc-cluster-setup
chmod 700 cluster-setup

All configuration from this point on is automated
./cluster-setup {compute|head}
	Take defaults, except that pkgsrc install number should always be [1]
	unless you want to install a second tree for some reason
