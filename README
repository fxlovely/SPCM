The SPCM cluster manager is a free, open source integrated tool set for managing a simple HPC (High Performance Computing) cluster.

It is the only portable cluster management suite we are aware of and is designed to be easily adapted to most POSIX platforms.

SPCM automates the process of configuring a head node, compute nodes, file servers, and visualization nodes. Most common management tasks can be performed using a simple menu interface, while additional tasks are supported by command-line tools.

SPCM automatically installs and integrates the SLURM scheduler and the Ganglia web-based network monitoring suite with the Apache web server. 

Goals
    Easy to port to any POSIX platform
	Like the pkgsrc package manager, which is heavily utilized by
	cluster-admin, we are committed to implementing all code in the
	most portable way possible (limited to POSIX platforms).
    Uniform user interface
    Support multiple platforms in the same cluster
    Simple - easy to build and manage a small to medium cluster
    Fast - deploy and update nodes in minimal time

Rules
    All scripts conform to POSIX Bourne shell syntax
    Single script supporting all platforms is preferable in most cases
    Push most platform-dependent down to auto-admin
    Lightweight, minimalist, like the C language
	Nothing will be added to the base package if it can be
	implemented as a plugin

Status
    Not many features will be added, but much work remains to be done to
    clean up existing code, make it more robust, and support additional
    platforms.
