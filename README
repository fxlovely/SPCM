Goals
    Easy to port to any POSIX platform
	Like the pkgsrc package manager, which is heavily utilized by
	cluster-admin, we are committed to implementing all code in the
	most portable way possible (limited to POSIX platforms).
    Uniform user interface
    Support multiple platforms in the same cluster
    Simple - easy to build and manage a small to medium cluster
    Fast - deploy and update nodes in minimal time

Rules
    All scripts conform to POSIX Bourne shell syntax
    Single script supporting all platforms is preferable in most cases
    Push most platform-dependent down to auto-admin
    Lightweight, minimalist, like the C language
	Nothing will be added to the base package if it can be
	implemented as a plugin

Status
    Not many features will be added, but much work remains to be done to
    clean up existing code, make it more robust, and support additional
    platforms.
