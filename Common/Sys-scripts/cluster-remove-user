The following files are symbolic links.  The targets they point to
will NOT be removed automatically.  You MUST deal with these targets
before proceeding to avoid orphaning files on the cluster.

In a separate window:

1.  Open a root shell on each file server containing files to be archived
    or removed.

2.  Run "cluster-archive-user-dir <directory>" to archive directories to
    be saved before account removal.

3.  Visually inspect the user's home directory and remove any files
    that are obviously junk.  This will reduce noise in the steps that
    follow.

Scanning for files owned by $user_name...

There MUST be a link within $home_dir to every directory outside
$home_dir containing files owned by $user_name.

If there is not, create all necessary links before proceeding.

We will then view a list of all files owned by $user_name.

EOM
pause

find -L $home_dir -user $user_name | more

cat << EOM

If there are other any files owned by $user_name that you would like to
save, archive them or chown them to another user NOW.  Be sure to
set both owner and group to something that will exist after
$user_name is removed.

Make sure *ALL* files outside $home_dir are removed, archived, or
assigned to another user before you continue.

Files in $home_dir will be removed automatically if you choose
not to archive it.

Type "All files removed" when you are done.  Type anything else to abort
the removal.
